Every element does not have an id -­‐> static id, unique name,unique link text.
For those elements we need to build xpath to find and then perform actions on them.
Whatever we use to find an element, id, name, xpath, css -­‐> It should always be unique.
It should only find one matching node unless we want to capture a list of elements.
