#16/3/24---
#Write a function to print from 1 to 10
#Write a function to from 10 to 1
#Creata a function having variable length argument for sum - it should provide sum for 1argument also,2argument also,5argument also
#Ex:- Sum(1)=1; Sum(2,3)=5, Sum(2,2,2,2)=8
#Above program can be done for Multiply also
#Create a function which takes user details like name,age, city and print all those details.(Keyword Variable length arguments)-**
